# license-checker
This is a tool to check the used third party packages in your project for licenses that you do not want.

Note: We can use this tool to detect licenses when the project on github does not have any indecators(https://github.com/go-enry/go-license-detector).
Note: Here is an other tool that is used by github to detect licenses in repos: https://github.com/licensee/licensee
Note: Here is documentation on how github is detecting licenses in the repos: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#detecting-a-license
